While Cyber Republic is certainly part of Elastos, the future governance and economic model of this project will be self-organized by the members of Cyber Republic, not The Elastos Foundation. Cyber Republic will in many ways become completely independent of the Foundation and control its own destiny. This vision, however, will take time to achieve.',

This Council, made up of members Fay Li, Kevin Zhang, and Yipeng Su, will utilize community input and make strategic decisions to grow the project. In time, the members of the Empower35 project along with other leaders in Cyber Republic will form a government and become self-running. Our Constitution is currently in progress.',

They can be coded to included things like ’14-day money back guarantee’ and every other element that is in a normal contract. Drastically improving efficiency and breeds a new generation of trust.

P2P refers to the relationship between entities to entities, not physical computers to computers. The ID of a P2P network represents an individual or an entity, not a computer. Today, we can use our ID to communicate with someone on our cellphones. Tomorrow, even if I change a cellphone, we can still communicate with the same ID.

In this case, the Bitcoin blockchain works as the parent blockchain to Elastos, with the Elastos chain as its auxiliary blockchain. The mining pools will deploy merged mining code and miners will submit proof of work to both blockchains at the same time. Energy consumption does not increase with merged mining, and will be equal to the energy consumed for mining either alone. Through this mechanism, the Elastos blockchain has an extremely strong guarantee of computing power and will then be able to provide blockchain innovations at a global scale. It makes full use of existing Bitcoin computing resources in addition to being environmentally friendly.',

Miner submits Proof of Work(PoW) to both Bitcoin and Elastos and enjoys profits of mining competition without extra consumption of computing power. The consensus mechanism for Elastos is AuxPoW+DPoS where the mining reward distribution is 70% for AuxPoW + DPoS(miners + stakers) and 30% for Ecosystem Application Reward(aka Cyber Republic Fund). Tokens for apps built on Elastos can be published on sidechains. These tokens may participate in two-way asset transfer across the main chain and sidechains.',

This means that every application can create individual sidechains. The Elastos blockchain provides built-in, complete, easy-to-use sidechain support. They will also be customizable, allowing clients to pick a different consensus method depending on the use case.',

This is a fundamental reason why blockchains still cannot be applied on the internet at a large scale. The Elastos team recognizes this fact, and therefore believes that blockchain development should not rely solely on the main chain for computation. Elastos aims to scale their blockchain system by providing support for sidechains, which will help meet requirements for running applications with high IOPS(Input Output Operations Per Second). The Elastos main chain will be responsible for the small but very important role of trading and transferring ELA, thus providing stability to the blockchain system. Elastos wants to avoid bloating the main chain with unnecessary smart contracts. Instead, only major infrastructure upgrades will take place on the main chain. All other smart contracts can be implemented on sidechains, enabling scalability.',

     'developer.learn.started.assembly.title': 'What is CAR?',
     'developer.learn.started.assembly.part1': 'CAR means The Component Assembly Runtime (CAR). It is Java with machine code. It is COM with metadata.',
     'developer.learn.started.assembly.part2': 'It is a component-oriented programming model and also a programming idea, and it is described by special standards divided in two parts: specification and implementation. The specification part tells how to define the components and how to communicate among components. Following the specification, any language can be used. Thus, CAR can be implemented in many ways. Elastos operating system implements the CAR core services.',
     'developer.learn.started.assembly.part3': "CAR components provide service using interface, component interface needs the metadata to describe the component so that other users can know how to use the service. Metadata describe the relationship between services and calls. With this description, calling between different components becomes possible, and members of the long-range, inter-process communication can be properly carried out. The major solved problems by CAR component technology are: component from different sources can interoperate; components upgrade but affect no other component; component is independent of the programming language; transparency of component operating environment",
     'developer.learn.started.assembly.part4': "The programming idea with CAR is the essence technology in Elastos, it runs through the entire technology system implementation. In Elastos both the operating system kernel and the component library provided by Elastos platform are implemented using CAR technology. Closely integrated of the operating system kernel with CAR technology runtime environment can provide strong support to Elastos architecture.",
     'developer.learn.started.assembly.part5': "By doing this, you're able to use a CAR component to establish communication between a program written in C/C++ and one in HTML5/JS - being able to talk without confirming to one programming language. This leads to convenience for the developer as well as portability. This means that all the DApps can be run on a C++ virtual machine no matter what language the DApp is written in and this also means that there's no need of a bridge like a JNI that is vulnerable to many man-in-the-middle-attacks, virus attacks, etc. In addition, this also lets an elastos DApp use the full capability of the hardware as the program is able to directly talk to the hardware for things like game engines, multimedia codec, etc thereby enabling developers to build true decentralized applications powered by the blockchain technology which is also very secure and scalable at the same time.",
